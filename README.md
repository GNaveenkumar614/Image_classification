# Image_classification MNIST Medical images
The Medical MNIST dataset is a valuable resource
 for advancing medical image analysis, and this study focuses on
 preprocessing and classifying these images using convolutional
 neural networks (CNNs). By employing robust preprocessing
 techniques and optimized deep learning models, we achieved
 high classification accuracy, demonstrating the datasetâ€™s potential
 to improve diagnostic precision and support medical decision
making.
